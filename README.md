# Ensemble-Learning
Performing ensemble learning.

In this notebook, the following steps are performed:

1. The Condorcet's Jury Theorem (using the law of large numbers).
2. Using AdaBoost Classifier model to find a strong classifier, using n weak learners.
3. Analysis of the 'miRNA animals interaction prediction' dataset from Kaggle.
4. EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis (using visual tools to present and explain the data).
5. Preprocessing: transforming, cleaning and standardizing the data.
6. Model training: training a XGBoost Classifier.
7. Model evaluation: evaluating the model using different evaluation metrics.
8. Explainability: explaining the results of the model using SHAP.

The notebook is based on 'miRNA animals interaction prediction' dataset from Kaggle, and was developed using Python.
